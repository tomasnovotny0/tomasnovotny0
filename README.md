## About me
Hi,
I'm Tomáš from Czechia and I absolutely love programming. Here's my story about how I got into it.  
I first started learning Java during my studies on high school and I fell in love with it. After graduation I have tried to study programming in college,
but it didn't meet my expectations. Maybe that was also caused by the current pandemic as everything was done from home and I felt like, I'm not really learning anything at all.  
So I found some online courses and started going through them instead. And I think it was right decision. I learned new language - C# (even though it's quite similar to Java).
Then I started learning WPF and made few smaller applications.<br/>Currently I'm learning Python and looking for my first software developer job. Wish me luck.

## Languages
- Java
- C#
- Python (learning)

## Projects
All my projects which I want to share with the world can be found [here](https://github.com/tomasnovotny0?tab=repositories) on my github profile.
